    <img height="190" width="330" align="right" src="http://www.beijingxiantour.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/The-Huge-Forbidden-City-Complex1.jpg">
    <em>The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty (1420-1912). It is located in the centre of Beijing, China, and now houses the Palace Museum.</em>
    <p><em>It served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political centre of Chinese government for almost 500 years.</em>
    <p><em>Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres).The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987,and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.</em>

    <em>Zhong Guan Cun is a technology hub in Haidian District, Beijing, China. It is geographically situated in the northwestern part of Beijing city. Zhongguancun is very well known in China, and is often referred to as "China's Silicon Valley".</em>
    <p><em>Zhongguancun has long existed since 1950s and only became a household name in the early 1980s. The first person who envisioned the future for Zhongguancun was Chen Chunxian, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), who came up with the idea for a Silicon Valley in China after he visited the U.S. as part of a government-sponsored trip. </em>
    <p><em>The location of the Chinese Academy of Sciences within Zhongguancun reinforced, and perhaps was in part responsible for the technological growth in this area.</em>
